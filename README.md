# Hello_World
Just another repository
I am Belmy Semape Maripane, I currently work at PRP Solutions as Junior Hardware Technician,
I am lazy person with leak of focus towards my dreams, I have interest in coding languages, as growing up I love knowing more about electronics, 
working with my father at his workshop for mechanic for cars, I became more interested in car  and wanted to be a mechinical engineer like my father.
Well... life happpens and I am Electronic Techincian from University of Johannesburg, I realised I have lot to learn since started working close to Electrical engineers at PRP Solutions
They inspired me to learn coding languages and study further to become an engineer to achieve my dream since I was a kid.
I have personality of enjoying my own space and spending time with myself, my phone and my laptop, I'm not that of a social person, yes I am able to socialise with people
I just prefer to stay alone be a nard kind of a person than being on the street, I used to do street likfe and I grow up and realise spend time at home is better than on street.
